# hw2
For simplicity this program runs all parts of the homework by executing `main.py`
- Running > `python` Python 3.8.2 (default, Nov  4 2020, 21:23:28) [Clang 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.28)] on darwin
- `python main.py` 

**Note, run time can be quite lengthy on the order of 30 minutes.**
Scoring on `train` is commented out in the current version. 

The program is driven from main --

1. Part 1 is all contained in `hidden_markov_model.py`
1. Part 2 is contained in `trigram_hmm.py`

Test data is packaged with the application and should with the relative paths intact
